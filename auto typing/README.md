# ✍️ Auto Typing Effect

**Auto Typing Effect** is a clean and minimal JavaScript-based typing animation that mimics a typewriter effect.
Words appear one character at a time, pause, then get deleted in reverse before transitioning to the next word.
It's perfect for portfolios, developer intros, or landing pages.
